# Heart-Attack-Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the risk of heart attacks using machine learning techniques implemented in R. The analysis is based on a dataset containing various medical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and chest pain type. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and the application of classification models including logistic regression and random forests. Performance evaluation was conducted using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC. Visualizations were created to highlight key patterns and support model interpretation. The project demonstrates how R can be used to build a reliable predictive model for heart attack risk, with potential applications in preventive healthcare and early diagnosis support.
